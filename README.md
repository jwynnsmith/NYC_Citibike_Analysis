# NYC_Citibike_Analysis
The month of January 2018 shows ridership growing from from 5500 on January 1 to 31,276 by January 31.  This growth correlates with the low ridership during the New Years Holiday in the beginning of the month and an increased ridership towards the end of the month as people return to work.  There were relative drops in data on the weekend days and holidays (i.e. January 6-7 and January 13-15).

The percentage of 1-day and 3-day riders (short-term) to annual customers (long-term) were always less than 0.5% with the exception of January 27, 2018. This means an overwhelming majority of the customers have an annual membership. 

The peak hours for ridership are during he 8 AM and 5 PM hours with steady increases in the ridership 4 hours preceding the peaks.

The Pershing Square North CitiBike Station is the most popular start and end station with 8,000 + incidences of starting and stopping a trip respectively.  West 21st and 7th Ave is the 2nd most popular for starting and ending a trip.

Despite growth in ridership for both women and men in January 2018, men took 3.5 times more trips than women.

Trip duration is the highest for people between the ages of 49 to 65.

17962, 18130, 18281, 20068, 21018, 21218, 24335, 24336, 26777, 27699 are the bikes with the most miles traveled and likely the bikes in urgent need of repair.
